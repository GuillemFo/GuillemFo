# 👋 Hi, I'm Guillem Forns

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a developer who loves problem-solving and building projects that matter. My work spans **system programming, algorithms, application development**, and **modern web development with TypeScript**.

I began my journey at **42**, and along the way, I’ve honed my skills in **C, C++, Unix-based development**, and **TypeScript**, always eager to learn and tackle new challenges.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me flying **RC planes and cars**, **fishing**, or exploring **Rubik’s cubes**—not to solve them quickly, but to rediscover their patterns every time. Curiosity and play fuel my creativity in code and beyond.
