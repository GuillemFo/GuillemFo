# 👋 Hi, I'm Guillem Forns  

I'm a developer **fascinated by problem-solving** and creating projects that make an impact and **help people**.  
From **system programming and algorithms** to **application development** and **modern web apps**.  
I love a good challenge—it's what pushes me to **learn, grow, and explore new ideas**.  

My journey began at **42**, where I built a solid foundation in **C, C++, and Unix-based development**.  
Since then, I've used every opportunity to **expand my skills, experiment with new technologies**, and take on projects that **stretch my limits**.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:  
✈️ Flying **RC planes**  
🎣 Fishing  
🧩 Exploring **Rubik’s cubes**—not to solve them quickly, but to rediscover their patterns every time
